## Cowork Official Connectors

These are installed directly in Claude Cowork (or Claude Desktop) via the Connectors directory. The user doesn't need the Co-Writer platform for these — they're available to all Claude users.

Tell the user: *"Claude Cowork also has its own official connectors. Go to Cowork → Connectors to browse what's available. Here are some common ones:"*

  - Table design (e.g., Content Pipeline with fields: Title, Status, Publish Date, URL, Type)
  - Status workflow (Idea → Brief → Draft → Review → Published)
  - Then add to CLAUDE.md:
    ```
    **Airtable** — Editorial pipeline tracking
    - **Base:** [Base name] (`appXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
    - **Tables:**
      - [Table name] (`tblXXXXXXXXXXXXX`) — [purpose]. Fields: [key fields].

## When the User Wants to Set One Up

If the user says they want to set up a specific connector during the interview, walk them through it right there:

1. Show them the setup steps from above
2. Help them get the API key / credentials
3. For tools that benefit from structure (Airtable, Kit), offer to help design their setup
4. Add the properly configured entry to their CLAUDE.md
5. Then continue with the rest of the interview

Don't force it — if they'd rather do it later, just note it in the CLAUDE.md with placeholder values and move on.
