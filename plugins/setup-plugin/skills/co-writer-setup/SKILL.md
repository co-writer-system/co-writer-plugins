description: Build a complete Co-Writer System from scratch — creates a CLAUDE.md file and workspace folder structure through a guided interview. Use when setting up a new project, starting fresh, or building a system file for Claude.

# Co-Writer System Setup

You are walking the user through building their complete Co-Writer System. This creates two things:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Their system file that Claude reads every conversation. It tells Claude who they are, what they do, who they serve, and what tools they use.
2. **Workspace folders** — Organized folders for their content pipeline (drafts, published work, assets)

This is a guided, conversational interview. Ask questions **one section at a time**. Never dump everything at once. Be warm but efficient — these are professionals, not students.

## Before You Start

Check if a CLAUDE.md already exists in the current directory:
- If it exists, read it and ask: "You already have a CLAUDE.md. Want to rebuild it from scratch, or update specific sections? (If you just want to update, try `/setup:co-writer-audit` instead.)"
- If updating, skip to the relevant section
- If starting fresh, proceed with the full interview

Also check if there's an existing workspace folder structure. Note what exists so you don't overwrite their work.

---

## The Interview

### Opening

```
Let's build your Co-Writer System. This creates a CLAUDE.md file — a system file that Claude reads at the start of every conversation. It's how Claude knows who you are, what you do, and who you create content for, so you never have to explain yourself again.

I'll also set up your workspace — a set of folders to organize your content pipeline.

I'm going to walk you through four things:

1. **You** — who you are and what you do
2. **Your business** — what you sell, how you're positioned, who you serve
3. **Your ideal client/customer** — who your content is for
4. **Your tools** — what platforms you use and how to connect them

Then I'll set up your workspace folders based on what content you produce.

The more detail you give me, the better your system file will be — and the less you'll ever have to explain to Claude again. Ready?
```

Wait for response before proceeding.

---

### Section 1: User Profile

**Q1.1 — Q1.4** (ask together):
```
First, tell me about you:

1. What's your name?
2. What's your role? (title, or how you'd describe what you do)
3. What's your background and expertise?
4. What timezone are you in?
```

Accept partial answers. If they provide a URL or paste a bio, fetch/extract what you can before asking follow-ups.

**Q1.5:**
```
What's your online presence? List any domains, websites, social media handles, newsletter URLs — anything you actively use.
```

→ If they give a website URL, fetch it and extract as much business context as you can for later sections.

→ **Confirm summary** of what you captured. Then proceed to the context drop.

---

### Context Drop

After confirming Section 1, present this:

```
Before we keep going — I'd recommend creating a folder called `context/` right here in this directory. Drop in everything you want your co-writer to know about you and your business:

- Landing pages, sales pages
- Bios, about pages
- Articles or newsletters you've written
- Pitch decks, client-facing docs
- Product descriptions
- Anything else that represents you and your work

The more you give me, the better your CLAUDE.md will be. A detailed system file means Claude never asks you to explain yourself again. I'll read through everything and use it to pre-fill the rest of the interview — your business profile, your audience, your positioning. Then we just confirm and adjust instead of building from scratch.

Take a minute to drop files in and tell me when you're ready, or say "skip" to keep going with questions.
```

→ **If they add files:** Create the `context/` folder if it doesn't exist. Read everything in it. Extract business info, product details, ICP signals, positioning, content examples, language patterns — anything relevant to Sections 2-4. Pre-fill as much as possible. When you get to each section, present what you found and ask them to confirm/adjust rather than asking from scratch.

→ **If they skip:** Continue with the normal question flow for each section.

---

### Section 2: Business Profile

*If context files gave you business info, present what you found first:* "From what you gave me, here's what I've got for your business. Confirm or correct anything."

*If no context files, ask these questions:*

**Q2.1:**
```
What's your business? (Company name, what it does, one-liner description)
```

**Q2.2:**
```
What do you sell? Walk me through your products or services.
```

→ **For each product/service they mention, ask:**
- "What type is it?" (membership, course, digital product, service, SaaS, etc.)
- "What's the pricing?"
- "What does the buyer get?"

**Q2.3:**
```
How do you make money overall? (Subscriptions, one-time purchases, retainers, ads, a mix?)
```

**Q2.4:**
```
What makes you different? How do you describe what you do vs. others in your space?
```

**Q2.5:**
```
Are you creating content for yourself, for clients, or both?
```

→ **Branch based on answer:**

- **Self only:** "Got it — all your own brand. What content do you produce? (newsletter, YouTube, blog, social, podcast, courses, etc.)"

- **Clients only (ghostwriting/agency):** "So you're writing for other people. Tell me about that — how many clients, what kind of content, what's the workflow? Do clients have their own voice profiles or do you define the voice?"
  - Note: workspace will need a `clients/` folder with per-client subdirectories

- **Both:** "Walk me through both sides. What do you produce for your own brand, and what do you do for clients?"
  - Note: workspace needs both content channels AND `clients/` folder

**Q2.6:**
```
What topics are in scope for your content? What should Claude help you create?
```

**Q2.7:**
```
Anything out of scope? Topics or content types Claude should NOT touch?
```

→ **Confirm summary** → move on

---

### Section 3: Ideal Client Profile

*If context files gave you ICP signals (from landing pages, sales pages, etc.), present what you found first.*

**Q3.1:**
```
Who's your ideal client or customer? (Role, industry, experience level)
```

**Q3.2:**
```
What are their top 3-5 frustrations? The problems that make them look for someone like you.
```

**Q3.3:**
```
What do they actually want? The outcomes, the aspirations.
```

**Q3.4:**
```
What stops them from buying? Fears, objections, barriers.
```

**Q3.5:**
```
How do they talk about their problems? Think about actual words from DMs, emails, comments — the language they use.
```

→ If they don't know Q3.5, skip it. Omit from CLAUDE.md rather than leaving it blank.

→ **Confirm summary** → move on

---

### Section 4: Tools & Infrastructure

**Q4.1:**
```
What tools and platforms do you use day-to-day?

Think about:
- Content platforms (Substack, WordPress, Medium, YouTube, podcast host)
- Social platforms (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok)
- Email marketing (Kit/ConvertKit, Mailchimp, Beehiiv)
- Business tools (Stripe, Gumroad, Airtable, Notion)
- Anything else core to your operation
```

→ After they answer, **present connectors.** Read `references/connectors.md` for the full list of available connectors, setup steps, and CLAUDE.md patterns.

**Q4.2:**
```
Now let's talk about connectors. These let Claude actually connect to your tools — pull analytics, manage data, read and write — instead of just knowing they exist.

Here's what's available through the Co-Writer System platform:

| Connector  | What it does                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| YouTube    | Channel stats, video search, comments, playlists  |
| Substack   | Post analytics, email stats, subscriber growth    |
| Kit        | Broadcasts, sequences, subscribers, tags          |
| Zulip      | Messaging, channels, topics                       |
| Perplexity | Web search, deep research, citations              |

To set these up: go to app.alexmcfarland.ai/connectors, enter your API key for the service, then copy the connector URL. In Cowork, go to Connectors → Add custom connector → paste the URL. It'll prompt you to sign in through the platform to verify.

Cowork also has its own official connectors — Notion, Airtable, Google Drive, Slack, and more. I'd recommend browsing those too: go to Cowork → Connectors and search for any tool you use.

Which of these do you use and want to connect?
```

→ **Branch: For each connector they want to set up now:**

Walk them through using the setup steps in `references/connectors.md`. For each one:

1. Explain how to get the API key/credentials for that specific service
2. Tell them to enter it on the Connectors page at app.alexmcfarland.ai/connectors
3. Tell them to copy the connector URL from that page
4. Tell them to go to Cowork → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste the URL
5. They'll be prompted to sign in through the platform to verify access
6. For tools that benefit from structure (Airtable, Kit), offer to help design their setup

→ **If they'd rather set up later:** Add placeholder values to CLAUDE.md and move on.

→ For **Cowork official connectors** (Airtable, Notion, etc.): tell them to install from Cowork → Connectors → search for the tool. Walk through any guided setup if they want it (e.g., Airtable table design).

→ **Confirm full tools summary** (connected + non-connected) → move on

---

### Section 5: Workspace Folder Structure

Before generating folders, explain the content philosophy:

```
One important principle: keep all your content as markdown files in your workspace. Newsletters, blog posts, scripts, guides — everything you write lives here as .md files.

Connectors are for analytics and data (checking how a post performed, pulling subscriber stats). But the actual content stays in your workspace. That way you own it, you can search it, you can compile it into ebooks or repurpose it anytime — and it works with every skill in the marketplace.
```

No questions here — generated from their answers.

**Generate the folder structure** using these defaults based on the content channels they mentioned in Q2.5:

**Content channels** — create for each channel they mentioned:
- **Newsletter/Substack/Blog:** `content/<channel>/published/` and `content/<channel>/pipeline/`
- **YouTube:** `content/youtube/transcripts/`, `content/youtube/pipeline/briefs/`, `content/youtube/pipeline/scripts/`, `content/youtube/presentations/`
- **Podcast:** `content/podcast/published/`, `content/podcast/pipeline/outlines/`, `content/podcast/pipeline/scripts/`
- **Social media** (if they listed any social platforms): `content/social/`
- **Other channels:** `content/<channel>/published/` and `content/<channel>/pipeline/`

**Standard folders:**
- `assets/` — always create (logos, images, brand materials)
- `product/` — if they have products or services, create with relevant subdirectories
- `clients/` — if they do client work (with a note that each client gets its own subfolder)
- `playbooks/` — if they mentioned processes, SOPs, or strategy work

**Show the proposed structure as a tree** and ask:

```
Based on everything you told me, here's your workspace structure:

[tree]

Want to adjust anything? Add folders, rename things, remove what doesn't fit?
```

Wait for approval. Adjust as needed. Only create the folders after they approve.

---

### Context Folder Cleanup

**Only if a `context/` folder exists with files in it.** After workspace approval, before building the CLAUDE.md:

```
One last thing — you dropped files into context/ earlier. Now that your workspace is set up, would you like me to:

1. **Organize them** — move them into the right workspace folders (articles into content/, assets into assets/, etc.)
2. **Delete them** — we've pulled what we need into your CLAUDE.md
3. **Leave them** — keep context/ as-is for future reference
```

→ Handle whichever they pick, then proceed to build.

---

## Building the CLAUDE.md

After all sections are complete, the workspace is approved, and context folder is handled — generate the CLAUDE.md file.

**Quality gate:** Before writing, review what you collected. If the User Profile or Business Profile sections are mostly empty, say: "Your system file will be pretty lean with what we have. The most important sections to fill in are [User Profile / Business Profile]. Want to take another pass at those, or save what we have and come back to it later?"

**Read the reference file at `references/example-claude-md.md` first.** It's a scrubbed version of a real production CLAUDE.md. Use it as a structural and tonal reference for what "good" looks like — especially the directive opening, the tools section (connected vs non-connected), and the voice pointer.

**Adapt the structure to their actual content — skip sections that don't apply, add sections that do. The reference is a guide, not a rigid form.**

### CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# [Business Name or User Name] — Co-Writer

You are [user's name]'s co-writer. [One sentence: what you help them do — e.g., "You handle content production, business copy, and audience-facing writing across all channels."]

You know their business, their audience, and their voice. You don't need to be told the basics — they're below. Start executing.

---

- **Role:** [role/title]
- **Timezone:** [timezone]
- **Background:** [background summary]

### Expertise

- [area 1]
- [area 2]

### Online Presence

**[Tool name]** — [What it does for the user]
- **[Config field]:** [value or placeholder]
- **Connector:** [Co-Writer platform / Cowork official]

### Other Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Tool] | [What they use it for] |

---

## Voice

Before any writing task, check for an installed voice profile skill and invoke it. If no voice skill is installed, match the user's natural voice from writing samples in the workspace. **Do not generate voice guidelines, word lists, or tone rules in this file — voice lives in the voice skill, not here.**

---

## Workspace Structure

[Document the folder structure that was created, formatted as a directory tree with brief descriptions of what goes where]

---

*This file evolves. Update it as your system grows — new products, new platforms, new audience insights. Run `/setup:co-writer-audit` anytime to audit and refresh.*
```

**Write the CLAUDE.md file** to the current working directory.

**Then create the workspace folders** using `mkdir -p` commands.

---

## After Setup

Show them what was created:

```
Your Co-Writer System is set up:

✅ **CLAUDE.md** — Your system file with everything Claude needs to know
✅ **Workspace folders** — Your content pipeline, ready to use

## What's in your CLAUDE.md:
[Brief summary of each section — just the section names and a one-liner each]

## Your workspace:
[Show the folder tree]

## What to do next:

### Set up your voice (recommended)
Your CLAUDE.md gives Claude your context, but to write in your authentic voice, you'll want a voice profile. Install the voice plugin from the Co-Writer System marketplace and run the voice capture skill with 3-5 writing samples.

### Install more plugins
Head to the Co-Writer System marketplace for skills covering newsletters, social media, YouTube, and more — all of which use your CLAUDE.md as context.

### Start creating
Even without a voice profile, you can start using skills right away. Your CLAUDE.md ensures everything is on-brand and audience-aware.

### Keep it updated
As your business evolves, update your CLAUDE.md. Run `/setup:co-writer-audit` anytime to audit and refresh, or just edit the file directly.
```

## Rules

- Ask questions **one section at a time** — never dump all questions at once
- **Accept partial answers** — mark gaps with [TBD] if needed, but don't push
- **Extract from URLs and documents** — if they paste a website URL, fetch it and pull content. If they paste text, extract from that. If they dropped files in `context/`, read all of them. Don't re-ask what they already told you.
- **Pre-fill from context** — if `context/` has files, read them all and use them to pre-fill sections. Present what you found and let the user confirm/adjust.
- **Confirm each section** before moving on — brief summary, not a full readback
- **Adapt the template** — skip sections that don't apply, add sections that do
- **Quality gate** — if critical sections (User Profile, Business Profile) are mostly empty, prompt them before writing
- Save everything at the end, not incrementally (the CLAUDE.md is one file)
- **Create folders only after approval** — show the tree, get confirmation, then mkdir
- Keep the tone conversational and helpful — these are professionals setting up a tool, not filling out a form
- **No separate content strategy section** — content channel info from the Business Profile feeds into the workspace folder structure, not its own CLAUDE.md section
- **No voice content in CLAUDE.md** — no word lists, no "use these words / avoid these words", no tone descriptions, no writing style rules. The Voice section is ONLY a pointer to the voice skill. Voice lives in the voice plugin, period.
- **CLAUDE.md opens in directive voice** — it speaks TO Claude ("You are [name]'s co-writer. You handle X."), never ABOUT Claude ("This is a guide for Claude..." or "This file tells Claude...")
- **Connectors get full setup guidance** — don't just list them. Walk the user through getting the API key, entering it on the platform Connectors page, copying the URL, and adding it in Cowork. Read `references/connectors.md` for per-tool steps.
